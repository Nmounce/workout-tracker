## Description

![](/public/images/functionality.gif)
Workout Tracker is a simple tracking application that can be used to help
consumers reach their fitness goals by logging daily exercises. Users can input
the name and type of an exercise, as well as any corresponding information such
as duration, number of reps, weight, number of sets, and distance, for cardio
exercises. The app dashboard automatically displays weekly summary graphs of all
workouts completed within specified time periods. This application was built from starter code using MongoDB and
Mongoose.
